    <h1>Description</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Fuul is a beloved fava bean stew that has long been
            woven into the culinary fabric of East Africa, North
            Africa and the Middle East. It's also known as
            ful medames or foul mudammas</p>
        <p>This comforting stew is served in a variety of ways:
            slow-simmered whole beans topped with juicy tomatoes
            and olive oil, or simply crushed and spritzed with
            lemon juice. This recipe is for Somali-style fuul,
            which consists of smashed fava beans and receives
            its intoxicating smell from the xawaash mix.</p>
        <p>Fuul is often eaten for breakfast alongside eggs and
            fresh anjero</p>

            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) can small fava beans, rinsed</li>
            <li>¼ cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 handful cilantro leaves, washed and roughly chopped</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot or deep skillet over medium heat, warm up the olive oil. Once the olive oil is hot, add
                the
                onion and stir. Let the onions cook, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and almost translucent,
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the onions have cooked, add in the garlic and let it cook until it softens, about 2 minutes. Add
                the
                roughly chopped tomatoes and let them cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 8 minutes or until they
                start to
                break down. Add the salt.</li>
            <li>While the tomato mixture cooks, prepare the xawaash mix: Add the cumin, coriander, black pepper,
                cinnamon
                and cardamom to a small nonstick pan. Toast over low heat, stirring continuously, for 1 minute or until
                the
                spice mix becomes fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the xawaash mix to the simmering tomato and onions. While the tomatoes finish cooking, add the
                rinsed
                fava beans to a medium bowl and use a pestle to mash them until there are almost no whole beans left.
                Stir
                the mashed beans into the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, 1 cup of water and the chopped cilantro leaves into the bean and tomato
                mixture.
                Cover the pan and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Stir in up to an additional ⅓ cup of water if the
                stew
                gets too thick.</li>
            <li>Serve the fuul with anjero, if desired. Leftovers keep for about a week in the refrigerator.</li>
