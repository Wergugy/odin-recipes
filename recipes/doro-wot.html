    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Doro Wat is one of the most famous of all African dishes.  
     You will find it in every Ethiopian restaurant and virtually 
     anyone who is familiar with African cuisine will have heard of it</p>
     <p>Traditionally Doro Wat is served with an Ethiopian flatbread 
        called injera.  It's kind of a spongy pancake made with teff 
        flour (a grain indigenous to the area), and the batter is left 
        to ferment for up to 4 days before its used.  The injera is 
        used in place of an eating utensil and is used to scoop up 
        the chicken stew.</p>
        <p>The key to authentic, great-tasting Doro Wat is good quality, 
            flavorful berbere, and a very long cooking process.  
            It can take several hours for an Ethiopian to make Doro Wat.  
            You can cut back on the cooking time and your Doro Wat will 
            still taste good, but it won't taste like it's supposed to.  
            The magic is in the slow-cooked onions.  And it takes time 
            for the magic to happen.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and pour lemon

                30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the niter kibbeh or butter along with the olive
                 oil in a Dutch oven. Add the onions and saute, 
                 covered, over low heat for 45 minutes, stirring 
                 occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the berbere and the 2 remaining tablespoons
                 of butter and saute, covered, over low heat 
                 for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>    
            <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon butter

            <li>Add the chicken, broth, salt and wine and bring

            <li>Adjust the seasonings, adding more berbere 
                according to heat preference. Add the boiled eggs 
                and simmer on low heat, covered, for another 15 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Half or quarter the eggs and arrange on the plates 
                with the stew. Serve hot with injera, bread or rice</li>
